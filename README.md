One of the jobs that all teachers have in common is evaluating students. Whether you use exams, homework assignments, quizzes, or projects, you usually have to turn students’ scores into a letter grade at the end of the term. This often involves a bunch of calculations that you might do in a spreadsheet. Instead, you can consider using Python and pandas.

One problem with using a spreadsheet is that it can be hard to see when you make a mistake in a formula. Maybe you selected the wrong column and put quizzes where exams should go. Maybe you found the maximum of two incorrect values. To solve this problem, you can use Python and pandas to do all your calculations and find and fix those mistakes much faster.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

- Load, clean(simple clean), and merge data from multiple sources with pandas

- Filter and group data in a pandas DataFrame
- map values from one set to another

- Calculate and plot grades in a pandas DataFrame

## Final results

You get 3 graphics, and a resulting file "Section x Grades.csv" for each section


## Files

On data folder you will see the original data. The resulting files will be written on this path too.

On 'other' folder you get the final code divided on steps.

Also, there, is 'generate_data.py'. With this file you can generate more example files.
## Installation

Create a Python virtual environment

OS X & Linux:

```sh
$ python -m venv ./venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $
```

Windows:

```sh
$ python -m venv venv
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $

```
> This prompt may vary if you use another shell configuration, like pk10

Later, to deactivate the virtual environment
OS X & Linux & Windows:

```sh
(venv) $ deactivate
$
```

## Run the project

```sh
python gradebook.py
```

## View jupyter notebook gradebook_notebook.ipynb

```sh
jupyter notebook

```
